# ob-set-defaults is the tool to use to change G_SPEAK_HOME, YOBUILD,
# PREFIX, and package names suffix etc. properly, such that
# 'debuild -b' would produce a valid debian package.
# See "ob-set-defaults --help" (and, if this project has it, ci/ob-set-defaults.conf).

# PREFIX is where this project should be installed.
# By default, it's the same as G_SPEAK_HOME.
# To change it independently, do e.g.
#   ob-set-defaults --g-speak 3.28 --prefix /opt/a-better-place
# or set PREFIX in ci/ob-set-defaults.conf.
