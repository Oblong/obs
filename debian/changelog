    g-speak version rather than project.

oblong-obs (1.22) bionic; urgency=low

  * uberbau: mirror third-party rather than nodejs6; check YOVERSION, too.
  * obs.bats: don't fail if g-speak not yet built
  * uberbau: no longer mirror qt531 and westar; they are no longer used as of g-speak 4.2
  * uberbau: mirror: handle buildhost5 builder names better
  * uberbau: adjust to buildhost5; also, defer mirroring obs to avoid bootstrap failure.
  * bau: on ubuntu, keep obs in front of path; fixes obs build error due to stale obs.
  * Obey MASTER more thoroughly.
  * bslave.sh: fix usage message, handle missing pip3 on ubuntu
  * Makefile: get manpage to build on osx
  * buildbot/run-bslave: call bootstrap-obs.sh at startup
  * bau-defaults/buildshim-ubu: clear dependencies if not in container
  * buildbot/run-bslave: start x if it's not already started on linux
  * buildbot/master.cfg: fix intuit_buildtype typo, add git describe step,
    shorten name of builders in gitlab ui

oblong-obs (1.21) bionic; urgency=low

  * buildbot/bslave.sh: support ubu1604
  * buildbot: helper scripts for running workers on mac, etc.
  * buildbot/bslave.sh: first draft of script to show how to create a worker.
  * buildbot/master.cfg: don't override default for gitlab status reporting; a static string isn't enough.
  * bs_is_try_build: also recognize pwd of *-try-* as a try build
  * buildbot/bslave.sh: Try to leave virtualenv in control; see platform/ob-repobot#76
  * bs_install_xcode_version: if xcodebuild aborts, run xcode-select unconditionally.
  * bau-defaults/buildshim-ubu: the pre-purging kludge makes using bau
    hard, so only do it if user is buildbot.

oblong-obs (1.19) bionic; urgency=low

  * On Ubuntu, default buildshim now handles --asan
    and uses ci/{tsan,lsan}-{suppressions,options}.txt if they exist.
    This makes it a lot easier to use asan.
  * When --asan or --tsan is given, add -as to package names.
    This makes it a lot easier to get and provide prebuilt sanitized
    dependencies.
  * Known issue: our packages' various flavors
    (e.g. -as and non-as, -cef3112 and -cef3282)
    install to the same location, but don't yet tell apt they replace
    each other, so apt errors out if you install one on top of the other.
  * The above is particularly painful on non-containerized
    ubuntu buildbots (and our 18.04 ones aren't containerized yet).
  * As a temporary expedient, on ubuntu 18.04, 'bau install-deps'
    does 'ob-remove.sh' first for now (!).
  * ob-set-defaults now handles oblong-rtsp-viddle-server properly
