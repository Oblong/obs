<h1>WIP buildbot - buildhost5</h1>

This buildbot is still being brought up.  You probably want <a href="buildhost4.oblong.com">buildhost4</a> for now.
<p>
The main page is <a href="http://buildhost5.oblong.com:8010">http://buildhost5.oblong.com:8010</a>.
<p>
Try build results are visible there, but most users will just look at the links on the merge requests.
<p>
Note: if logs are not very legible, you may have run into a chrome font problem on ubuntu;
<a href="https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/issues/4186">try uninstalling ttf-mscorefonts-installer</a>.

<h2>Apt server</h2>
Build results are available via an apt server.
To add this apt server to your Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 system, install <a href="oblong-repo/">the package oblong-repo</a>,
then do 'sudo apt-get update'.  You can then use 'sudo apt-get install ...' to install packages from this server.
<p>
However, this server is not yet complete.  Don't do that unless you want to see just how incomplete it is.

<h2>Obs server</h2>
To install packages via obs on mac, see <a href="https://gitlab.oblong.com/platform/obs/blob/master/README.md">the obs README</a>.
<p>
To temporarily switch to this server, do 'export MASTER=buildhost5.oblong.com' in the same shell window before running obs.

<h2>Buildbot Configuration</h2>
The configuration for this buildbot lives in
<a href="https://gitlab.oblong.com/platform/obs/blob/master/buildbot">platform/obs/buildbot</a>

See also <a href="https://gitlab.oblong.com/platform/docs/wikis/home">the platform wiki</a>.
